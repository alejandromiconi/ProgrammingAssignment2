## Write a short comment describing this function

## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    
    
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {

        return(m)

    data <- x$get()
    
    # For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    
    x$setinverse(m)
